REFLECTION

Currently, I have been sufferieng with constant migraines, something like this has happened in the past and i might know the cause. But i have to go to the doctor on monday to get help with it. 

My plan is to have done what I can over the weekend, taking many breaks to rest my head and hopefully show I do have an understanding of how everything works even if it isn't the most pretty looking guest book.

My basic to do list is;
Server and Client JS setup (done)
The form (done)
Wireframe (done)
database
Media Queries & CSS 

hopefully hitting all the points i need to convey I have an understanding of everything. However I may have to submit early and then have commits made after the deadline depending on how my head treats me. I will be going back to update the to do list with "done" to mark it down as done.
