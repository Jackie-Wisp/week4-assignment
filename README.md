REFLECTION

Currently, I have been sufferieng with constant migraines, something like this has happened in the past and i might know the cause. But i have to go to the doctor on monday to get help with it. 

My plan is to have done what I can over the weekend, taking many breaks to rest my head and hopefully show I do have an understanding of how everything works even if it isn't the most pretty looking guest book.

My basic to do list is;
Server and Client JS setup (done)
The form (done)
Wireframe (done)
database (Tables were set up, but the server won't connect to the db)
Media Queries & CSS (Half done)

hopefully hitting all the points i need to convey I have an understanding of everything. However I may have to submit early and then have commits made after the deadline depending on how my head treats me. I will be going back to update the to do list with "done" to mark it down as done. 


==============================

I have run into an issue in which the server won't connect to the DB and i do not know why, I am continueing to troubleshoot but without the ability to test if the information is working I may just have to attempt to do the code in the server right

=========================

This is the final bit of work that im doing tonight, I hope to be able to get some more done before this is graded. But I do believe I have at least showed understanding in everything that was taught throughout the week. For any feedback provided, I would like to know the reason I couldn't connect to the DB if at all possible. 

For a bit more of an explination as to the unrothadox nature of this submission, throughout the week I had been having migraine problems, and they flared up again over the weekend. Naturally a migraine stops me from looking at screens for periods of time. This has happened before so I believe I know the cause but I need to check with the doctors, sadly they are not open over the weekend. I was able to sleep a lot of sunday afternoon and the migraine became very dull, So I see it as getting up early monday morning to continue a lot of the work here. I'm hoping this can be taken into account when grading. 

As an overall reflection, I have enjoyed working with a client, server and database. Something about the logic here clicks with me more than CSS does. So I'm hoping for feedback to help improve my understanding. There is some mess in the code, which was me going back over demos and adding things in to make sure I understood what was happening and why things were occuring. I really wanted to make sure I knew what the code was doing for this.
